# Measuring the Accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition Solutions

[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3636513](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3636513)

The following tables list the recordings that were used for the dataset of this study.

\*We are not native English speakers or linguists. We define accent as a larger group of accents (e.g. North American). We categorised the samples, based on research of the speaker's vita or what we think the speakers fit into.
